# students

This project is just a simple back end web service and a front end user interface to look up student information.  The back end uses Node and Express.  The front end uses Backbone and Underscore.

To clone the project and run it locally:

    rjones$ git clone https://github.com/voidpointer/students.git
    Cloning into 'students'...

    rjones$ cd students

    rjones$ node app.js
    Student app listening on port 3000!

Then visit <http://localhost:3000/> in your web browser, or you can see it in action here: http://www.iamryanjones.com:3000/

Note: I don't think this will work in Internet Explorer because of the template literal strings in templates.js.
